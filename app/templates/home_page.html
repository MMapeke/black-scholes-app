  <h1>What is the Black-Scholes Model?</h1>
  <p>The Black-Scholes Model (BSM) is an equation used to model and predict the expected value of a European Call option on its expiration date. Several factors are used, such as time to expiration, current stock value, the volatility of the stockâ€™s historical price, and more. This model is a basic for option pricing and won the Nobel prize in Economics in 1997. People buying options usually pay a premium for the option and do not have to fulfill the exchange.

    <h2>Option</h2><p>Financial agreement/contract between two parties giving the owner of the option the ability to buy/sell a stock at a specific price (called the strike price or exercise price) on a specific date (called expiration date). Call options allow the owner to buy at the agreed price, while Put Options allows the owner to sell at the agreed price.</p>

    <h2>European Option vs. American</h2><p>European options may only be exercised on the expiration date, while American options can be exercised at any point.
